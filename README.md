# Binary Tree

## Project Description
This project is a simple yet efficient implementation of a binary tree data structure in C++. It reads a list of numbers, constructs a binary tree, and allows for deletion of nodes based on a second input list.

## Features
- **Binary Tree Construction**: Converts a list of numbers into a binary tree.
- **Number Deletion**: Deletes numbers from the tree using a second list of numbers.
- **Tree Visualization**: Outputs the tree to the terminal for visualization
